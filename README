WIFM-Map is a reconstruction of the world map of: "Matrix World in Flames".

Aim of the project are to produce a SVG representation of the MWIF world map
and to prototype algorithms to calculate various game relevant metrics. It
might encourage improvements to MWIF itself or lead to a spin off of itself.


Matrix Games is a registered trade mark, and that may or may not mean a lot
to them.. just be aware if when you do stuff..
